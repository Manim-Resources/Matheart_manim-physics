Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome! The repository owner (Matheart) might not be
available, any pull requests or issues will be attended by other developers.

There's three parts in a contribution:

1. The proposed addition/improvement.
2. Documentation for the new addition.
3. Tests for the addition.

Nearly all contributing guidelines here are identical to `Manim's Contributing
Guidelines <https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/contributing.html>`_.
